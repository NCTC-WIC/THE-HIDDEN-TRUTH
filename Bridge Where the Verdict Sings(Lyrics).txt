[Verse 1]
Verdict: you are whole now

Said over all your shame

Cries of a God still ringing

Through every hidden blame

Law like a shattered mirror

Mercy outside the frame

Humanity born broken

Could never outrun that name

[Pre-Chorus]
Inner accuser screaming

Inner victim small

Both of them bruised and bleeding

Pinned to the same hard wall (oh)

[Chorus]
Jesus is the bridge where the verdict sings

Justice

Mercy meet in His wounded wings

Da da

Bahha

Over the chasm wide

All of the fracture healed in His pierced side

We walk the bridge

From broken to whole

Step after step

He’s holding our soul

Da da

Bahha

Where war has to cease

At the bridge in Him

We finally breathe peace

[Verse 2]
Pages of ancient verdicts

Ink made of fear and loss

All of them torn and tangled

Hung on a wooden cross

Hidden like buried treasure

Truth under dirt and lies

Hands that were scarred uncovered

Light pouring into our eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel kingdoms shaking

When He whispers “done”

Every divided heartbeat

Pulled back into One (hey)

[Chorus]
Jesus is the bridge where the verdict sings

Justice

Mercy meet in His wounded wings

Da da

Bahha

Over the chasm wide

All of the fracture healed in His pierced side

We walk the bridge

From broken to whole

Step after step

He’s holding our soul

Da da

Bahha

Where war has to cease

At the bridge in Him

We finally breathe peace

[Bridge]
War in my ribs is ending

Right where His rivers run

Law that once only crushed me

Now dances with love as one

We are invited

Trembling

Fragments in open hands

Crossing that quiet crossing

Finding our promised land (oh)

[Chorus]
Jesus is the bridge where the verdict sings

Justice

Mercy meet in His wounded wings

Da da

Bahha

Over the chasm wide

All of the fracture healed in His pierced side

We walk the bridge

From broken to whole

Step after step

He’s holding our soul

Da da

Bahha

Where war has to cease

At the bridge in Him

We finally breathe peace
