[Verse 1: The Basin]
There is a place maps don’t name
where the ground stays wet—
not from rain, but remembering.
Salt from a face trained to cry quietly
so no one would ask what was wrong
and stay long enough to leave anyway.

I have worn this riverbank into a canyon,
not by force but persistence—
the same grief returning
for as long as I have known
love can exit
without closing the door.

[Pre-Chorus]
Some nights I don’t know why I’m crying.
It is the body remembering
what the mind buried—
the heart still waiting
for an apology
never scheduled to arrive.

[Chorus]
Waterrrr faaahhhllss!!
Waaaterrr faaaaaallss mmmhmhmhmmmm
Rivers from my eyes.
Waterrrr faaahhhllss!!
Flooding the silence I internalized.

[Verse 2: The Dam]
I tried to dam it once—
told myself tears were weakness,
that no one was coming to hold me,
so stop asking the dark to be hands.

But grief is not obedient.
It slips beneath walls,
through foundations,
into every attempt at peace.

One night in the driveway,
rain sounding like applause,
I stopped fighting
and let the waterfall have me.

[Pre-Chorus]
It was not liberation—
just wet, cold quiet,
like being buried
in the only substance
that understood.

[Chorus]
Waterrrr faaahhhllss!!
Rivers from my eyes.
Drowning in the open,
and no one hears.

[Verse 3: The Schism]
The waterfall was not the end
but the beginning of seeing.
When the tears cleared,
I saw the crack beneath my life.

Not in the floor,
nor only in those who failed me—
the crack was in the story
that said love must be earned,
that smallness makes people stay.

I had built my house
on that fault line.
Every river was the earth shifting,
saying: You cannot build here.
You were never the problem.
The story was.

[Pre-Chorus]
In that knowing the Schism opened—
not to swallow me,
but to reveal
what lay beneath.

[Chorus]
Waterrrr faaahhhllss!!
But the water was unveiling.
The crack became a doorway,
the tears a guide.

[Verse 4: The Bridge]
Across the split foundation
I saw it—already there.

The bridge.

Not earned, not built by me,
but waiting.
Made not of stone
but of Him—
wound shaped into love,
love shaped into staying.

[Pre-Chorus]
He did not ask why I waited.
He stood where the weight bears hardest,
held out a scarred hand—
a shape familiar
as every promise that dissolved.

[Chorus: Transformed]
Waterrrr faaahhhllss!!
Now the rivers are crossing.
I walk through the water,
and He walks with me.

[Verse 5: The Healing Walk]
I stepped—
the bridge held.
Another—
no splintering.

The Schism became witness,
evidence I survived.

The weight did not vanish;
it redistributed—
memory, mercy, timber beneath my feet.

This is the mystery:
you do not leave the burden—
you become the support.
You do not forget the river—
you become what carries others home.

[Pre-Chorus]
Healing is not the end of pain,
but pain becoming passage,
tears becoming path,
first witness becoming
not the only one.

[Chorus: Declaration]
Waterrrr faaahhhllss!!
I am not drowning—
I am walking.
The water beneath me,
the bridge beneath the water,
and I am still becoming.

[Verse 6: The Cloud]
Behind me stands a crowded shore—
not those who broke me,
but those who also bled.

Ahead wait the unnamed bridge-builders.
No cheering—only presence.

And I see it:
the bridge does not end.
Through them, through me,
we are not travelers.

We are the bridge.

[Bridge: Holy Grief]
I did not ask to see the Schism.
The seeing cost everything—
except Him.

Not because the waterfall stopped,
but because He waded in.
Not because the bridge appeared,
but because He became it
and invited me
to become it too.

[Outro]
So here I am—
still wet, still carrying weight,
still bleeding a little,
still walking.

But not alone.

I walk toward the next one
standing at their own edge,
wondering if the bridge is real.

It is.
I tested it with my life.
Walk here.

I will stand at the center,
scar in my hand,
and say—

I know.
I know.
I know.

[Final, fading]
Waterrrr faaahhhllss...
Rivers from my eyes...

But the rivers are not the end—
they are the beginning

of the walk,
of the bridge,
of the home

I never had
until I became it.

Now walk.
