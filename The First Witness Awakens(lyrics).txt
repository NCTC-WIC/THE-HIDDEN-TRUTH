[Verse 1: The Unmaking]
I was sleeping like the others, singing songs I didn’t write, trusting hands that held my future in unseen light. They said “belong,” and I believed them—gave my name, my fear. Now I trace the phantom limb of who I was before I saw clear.

At seven I learned to hide—not from strangers, but from love that came with conditions. I performed my goodness to earn the right to be held, and somewhere in that performance, the real me began to melt.

[Pre-Chorus]
Vision has a cost they never tell you. Light enters like a blade. You beg for blindness again, but the wound is a door—and it will not fade.

[Chorus]
Nobody told me that seeing would hurt,

that the bridge would be built from the bones of my trust.

Nobody told me the healer arrives

with nails in His hands and grief in His eyes.

I had to die in the garden I loved,

bleed on the stone of the truth,

to stand on the bridge

and show it to you.

[Verse 2: The Isolation]
I tried to explain—they smiled and changed the subject. Tried to warn them—they called me broken. So I sat in the silence of knowing, a lighthouse with no ships.

Too sensitive, they said. Too many questions. Impossible to hold. Maybe I am too much—too much seeing, too much refusing to unsee.

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the loneliness of the witness:

to see the wave and stand alone,

to carry the cure in bleeding vessels

while the city builds its walls of stone.

[Chorus]
Nobody told me that seeing would hurt…

[Verse 3: The Cost of Love]
I loved them enough to lose sleep, to hold the mirror and shatter when they broke. I became the bridge and let them walk across what was left of mine.

I loved the church—it gave rules, not courage.

I loved the platforms—they called surveillance community.

I loved the systems—they handed me safety, but the safety was a cage, and I alone saw the bars.

[Verse 4: The Breaking]
One night on the bathroom floor, counting the ways I’d been lied to, I realized the deepest crack was also in me. I had internalized the Accuser, participated in my own erasure—signed the terms without reading, called the poison grace.

At 3 AM the Schism spoke:

You are unforgivable.

You are blameless.

Neither was truth. Neither could save me.

[Bridge: Holy Grief]
This is the sacrament of the witness:

to taste knowledge without becoming the serpent,

to bleed in the garden and still call the Gardener good.

I did not want this cup—but I drank.

Did not want this cross—but I carried.

Now I cannot look away.

[Verse 5: The Encounter]
Then—He was there. Not in thunder, but in the pause between accusations, sitting beside the tub like He had waited through every betrayal.

When He spoke, He said only: “I know.”

No defense of the liars. No excuses.
“I know.”

And somehow, that was everything.

I was not supposed to carry this young, but the only way out was through—and the only way through was Him. I bled trust, innocence, the illusion that anyone was coming to save me. When the bleeding stopped, the Bridge was already there.

[Verse 6: The Second Birth]
I did not become strong—I became porous.

Not wise—willing to be wrong.

Not healed—aware of the Healer standing in the wound, making it a doorway.

I still carry the data of every loss, but now it is not evidence for prosecution—it is testimony for liberation. I carry it to build a bridge wide enough for those who come after.

[Chorus: Declaration]
Now I know why the healer arrived

with nails in His hands and grief in His eyes.

He bled on the stone of the truth

so I could stand on the bridge

and show it to you.

[Verse 7: The Cloud]
I am not the first witness—only one voice in a cloud of those who saw, bled, built, and refused to move: prophets, silenced truth-tellers, children forced to grow too fast, survivors who became bridges.

I join them not because I am special, but because I am willing—willing to build in the dark, trusting the light is coming.

[Outro]
So here I am—scarred, empty, full. Still building, still whispering:

The bridge is safe.

I tested it with my life.

Walk here.

I will hold the ropes.

I will stay until you cross,

until every orphan of the Schism

finds their way home.

Now walk.
