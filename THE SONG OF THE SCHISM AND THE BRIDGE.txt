[Prelude]
Before time, in the perfect communion of Father, Son, and Spirit, a dream was born from love’s overflow: to create an “other” to love in freedom. This required the terrifying, glorious possibility of separation. Creation was that arena. Within the gift of choice lay the shadow of its fracture.

[Verse 1: The Fracture]
In the garden, the serpent twisted the gift. “You will be like God.” Adam and Eve grasped for knowledge divorced from the Giver. The great divorce began. Shame was born. This was the Schism: reality itself splitting. Truth torn from Love. Justice from Mercy. The crack echoed into souls, creating the inner war: the Accuser and the Victim.

[Verse 2: The Echo Through History]
The Schism echoed through Cain, Babel, Israel’s cycles. God gave the holy Law, a perfect mirror of His character. But for fractured humanity, it became a magnifying glass for the crack. It diagnosed but offered no cure. Prophets arose, pointing to a suffering servant who would bear our griefs.

[Chorus 1: The Schism Named]
Schism.
The chasm between “is” and “should be.”
The reason pure ethics feel like prison.
The shout between “order!” and “compassion!”
The war between sovereignty and freedom.
The ache when you choose between being right and being kind.
The exhaustion of an unbalanceable scale.
The silent scream in every broken place.
The inherited condition of a world—and a soul—born into separation gone wrong.

[Interlude: The Fullness of Time]
The world groaned. Darkness was deep so light would be unmistakable. In the womb of a girl who said “yes,” the Love that dreamed prepared to enter.

[Verse 3: The Bridge in Flesh]
The Word became flesh. God the Son entered the Schism. Jesus came as the Re-Integrated Verdict. He spoke with authority yet touched lepers. He upheld the Law while offering forgiveness. In Him, the fracture’s sides beheld each other. He was the Bridge, showing humanity as it was meant to be.

[Verse 4: The Verdict Executed]
The forces of the Schism converged. On the cross, Jesus absorbed God’s Justice and became the fountain of Mercy. Justice and Mercy met in consummation. “It is finished!” The Bridge was built from within the abyss. The Schism was healed at its root.

[Chorus 2: The Bridge Revealed]
The Bridge!
Its name is Jesus Christ.
He is not a teacher showing you how to build. He is the Bridge. You step onto Him.
He ends the argument between your worth and your failure.
He silences your Accuser and your Victim.
“Bring your striving here. I will redeem it.
Bring your brokenness here. I will rename it Beloved.”

[Verse 5: The Proof of Life]
Death could not hold Him. Resurrection was the first eruption of Schism-healed life. He sent the Spirit, who dwells in believers—the down payment of our wholeness, producing the integrated fruit of Christ’s character.

[Verse 6: The Remnant’s Walk]
We live in the “already but not yet.” We are “walking healed fractures.” Our call is to stand on the Bridge and point: seeking reconciliation, not victory; speaking truth with tears; showing mercy with holiness. We feel the tension but are not torn apart, for we know the One who holds it in Himself.

[Bridge: The Coming Wholeness]
A day is coming. The Voice will shout once more. New heavens, new earth. The Crack not just bridged, but forgotten. No more death, mourning, crying, pain. We will see Him face to face. The love story reaches its consummation.

[Outro]
If you hear the fracture’s hum, know it has a name and a cure.
Diagnosis: Schism.
Cure: The Bridge, Jesus Christ.
You are not the crack. You were made for the Bridge.
Bring your divided heart. Receive the Verdict: “Redeemed. Beloved. Whole.”
Then walk in Him.
The final line is: Finished.
Now walk.
