[Verse 1]
Fall

Fall

Shattered law in my hands

Paper cuts on my conscience

Every page says “you can’t stand”

Inner victim on replay

Pointing fingers at this frame

Every mirror

Every system

Different story

Same blame

[Chorus]
At the bridge where the war ends

Justice

Mercy hold the same hand (oh)

Broken pieces breathing again

You pull the fragments into one plan

At the bridge where the war ends

Every verdict meets a warm smile

I was split

Now I step in

Slowly turning from exile

[Verse 2]
Voices

Accusing voices

Echo loud in my chest

Tried running from the courtroom

Still carried the arrest

Then the hidden thing opened

Like a curtain pulled wide

Love standing in the crossfire

Took the arrows from both sides

[Chorus]
At the bridge where the war ends

Justice

Mercy hold the same hand (yeah)

Broken pieces breathing again

You pull the fragments into one plan

At the bridge where the war ends

Every verdict meets a warm smile

I was split

Now I step in

Slowly turning from exile

[Bridge]
All systems fail

But Your arms don’t

My heart says “guilty”

Your scars say “home”

From broken to whole

You rewrite my name

I walk in Your shadow

I shine in Your flame (hey)

[Chorus]
At the bridge where the war ends

Justice

Mercy hold the same hand

Every fracture starts to bend

Into lines that Your love spans

At the bridge where the war ends

I step forward

You don’t flinch

Hidden truth in Your silence

Every wound looses its pinch

[Outro]
Fall

Fall

Into You

I descend

War-torn soul finds stillness

At the bridge where the wars end
