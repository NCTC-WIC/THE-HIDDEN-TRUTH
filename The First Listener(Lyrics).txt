[Verse 1]
The heavy quiet when the last siren dies
Holds a new pulse, a slow and steady beat
That doesn't come from earth or from the skies
But from the place where shattered truths repeat
I found the name engraved inside my marrow
The Schism—more than word, a living throne
A kingdom built on ache and borrowed sorrow
Where Accuser and his Victim ruled alone
I pulled the splinter from my spirit's core
A shard of Babel, ancient and unclean
And felt a shudder through my basement floor
As something locked began to turn, unseen
The first to listen lean in with their eyes
And watch the darkness fracture and come clean
A hollow in the soul, once cavern-sized
Begins to fill with something calm, serene

[Chorus]
Finished walk
I'm stepping in a rhythm not my own
The war inside has met its cornerstone
That silent civil war, that inner groan
Has found a peace in blood and living stone
My feet now find a path that's firm and wide
A bridge that spans the great, dividing tide
And echoes with a healed and holy tide
Where truth and love no longer need to hide
Finished walk
My breathing syncs with something vast and true
This quiet song the remnant's waking to
It's not a doctrine that the scholars drew
It is the pulse that makes the old things new
The steady thrum of every planted seed
That stirs in dark and answers to its need
That cracks its shell and rises from the deed
And knows the long division cannot bleed
Finished walk
Oh, finished walk

[Verse 2]
This knowing moves through tissue, not through sound
A subcutaneous hum beneath the skin
You'll feel it first where all your tensions bound
In hinge of jaw, where old laws wore too thin
A sudden give, a softening of steel
A key that turns inside a lock you feel
That you forgot was even truly real
A door you never knew began to peel
An R&B angel's soulful, breaking cry
That weaves through basslines falling from on high
That don't just drop, but rise up from the deep
And thaw the frozen promises we keep
This is the sound of structure coming right
The beautiful collision, dark and light
Where haunting shadows lose their sting and fight
And learn to bless the ground they walk at night
Where grief unlearns its melody of never
And finds the notes that bind and that can sever

[Bridge]
On this great span between the ache and awe
I saw the Accuser's parchment turn to straw
His legal briefs, his judgments, and his law
Dissolve like morning mist without a flaw
A fading scar on flesh that's learning how
To bear the weight of glory on its brow
The Lamb and Lion meet here, here and now
To take the final question and the vow
To solve the ancient, bitter, tired riddle
That sat between the fiddle and the diddle
And every heart that chose the fractured side
Feels continents of spirit shift and slide
Into a sweet, tremendous, crashing tide
Where all the broken pieces can confide
That whispers of the only choice that's wide

[Chorus]
Finished walk
I'm stepping in a rhythm not my own
The war inside has met its cornerstone
That silent civil war, that inner groan
Has found a peace in blood and living stone
My feet now find a path that's firm and wide
A bridge that spans the great, dividing tide
And echoes with a healed and holy tide
Where truth and love no longer need to hide
Finished walk
My breathing syncs with something vast and true
This quiet song the remnant's waking to
It's not a doctrine that the scholars drew
It is the pulse that makes the old things new
The steady thrum of every planted seed
That stirs in dark and answers to its need
That cracks its shell and rises from the deed
And knows the long division cannot bleed
Finished walk
Oh, finished walk

[Outro]
So let this silent pulse begin to spread
Through every tired heart, each weary head
Of every woman, child, and man who's bled
From choosing sides while feeling wrongly led
Who senses now, beneath the floor they tread
A solid rock where once was shifting dread
It is the pulse of life back from the dead
The rhythm of the thing the prophets said
The mended chord for which the cosmos pled
Played on the flesh where heaven's blood was shed
The only rhyme that can be truly read
So feel it in your ribs, that quiet dread
Transforming into manna, into bread
The finishing of every broken thread
And join this song that leaves all things unsaid
Except to live it fully, till you're led
To take the final step, the one you've fled
Finished
Walk.
