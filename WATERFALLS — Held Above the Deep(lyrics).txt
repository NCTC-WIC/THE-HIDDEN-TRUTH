[Verse 1: The Basin]

I woke already drowning,
lungs learning water before they learned air.
Morning arrived — nothing in me rose to meet it.

Tears had labored through the dark,
patient as moon-pulled tides
filling chambers no one had entered.

My chest an inland sea,
my ribs a failing shore.

Even my breathing sounded distant,
like it belonged
to someone farther down.

Love had passed over me before —
mist without weight,
warmth without staying —
so I learned early: do not reach.
Arms always loosen.

Still the waters climbed,
quiet, deliberate, certain as gravity.

[Pre-Chorus]

Some nights I do not start the crying —
it begins without permission.
The body remembering
what the soul grew too tired to translate.

My heart still tilts toward silence,
listening for a voice
that never learned my name.

[Chorus]

Waterfalls — through my eyes,
steady as surrender.

An ocean pouring inward,
no shoreline, no horizon.

I am sinking slowly,
fully awake,
watching the last light thin
above me.

[Verse 2: The Dam]

I tried to be stone once.
Buried the rivers.
Spoke in level tones.
Smiled above the floodline.

But sorrow is ancient —
it does not argue.
It waits.

One night beneath a collapsing sky,
rain striking pavement like the applause of ghosts,
the final wall gave way.

The sea I carried rose to meet itself.

No violence.
No shouting.

Only depth…
and the terrible knowing
it had always been this deep.

[Pre-Chorus]

Not dramatic —
just cold inevitability,
like darkness
finally recognizing its own.

[Chorus]

Waterfalls — rivers from my eyes.
The whole world sleeping
while I disappear inside.

Tell me —
if no one hears a drowning,
does the water stop?

[Verse 3: The Schism]

Through blurred sight I saw it —
the fracture running under everything.

Not only those who left,
but the quieter lie beneath it:

Be less.
Need nothing.
Earn your staying.

So I abandoned myself first,
built my life along unworthiness,
called the trembling strength.

Every tear was the earth whispering:
you were never designed
to hold this alone.

[Pre-Chorus]

When the ground split open,
I expected disappearance.

Instead —
something held.

[Chorus]

Waterfalls — yet I remained.
The deep opened wide,
but did not claim me.

[Verse 4: The Bridge]

Across the black water stood One —
unmoving while everything in me gave way.

The bridge was not stone.
It was Jesus.

I was failing breath;
He was the air returning.
I was sinking weight;
He was the unseen foundation.

Not asking strength —
only my step.

[Pre-Chorus]

He did not measure my weakness.
He entered it —
scarred hands steady
inside the rising tide.

[Chorus: Transformed]

Waterfalls still falling —
but the sea meets
something stronger.

I am not holding back the dark.

He is.

[Verse 5: The Healing Walk]

I stepped — certain it would shatter.
It did not.

Again — and still He held.

The waters remained,
but the weight shifted.

What crushed my lungs
rested easily on His shoulders.

I remain weak —
astonishingly weak —
and it is finally enough.

Because He is not.

[Pre-Chorus]

Healing is not sunrise.
It is being kept
while the night continues.

Tears still fall —
never alone now.

[Chorus: Declaration]

Waterfalls — yet I walk.
Not by strength I gathered,
but strength that gathered me.

The ocean roars beneath,
and still
I cross.

[Verse 6: The Cloud]

Behind me — countless others
standing at their silent edges,
aching the same hidden ache.

The bridge does not end,
because He does not.

Those once carried
learn, in time,
to steady trembling hands —
not saviors,
only witnesses.

[Bridge: Holy Grief]

I never asked for sorrow this vast.
The seeing cost everything —
everything but Him.

The waterfalls remain.
The night remains.

So does Jesus,
wide enough
to hold back the entire sea.

[Outro]

So here I stand —
tear-worn, fragile, still aching —
yet the darkness no longer decides my ending.

If you fear the bridge will fail,
step forward.

I tested it
with the full weight
of my despair.

[Final — fading]

Waterfalls… still falling…

But the deep does not have me.

When I could not stand,
Jesus stood —

and that is stronger
than every ocean inside me.
