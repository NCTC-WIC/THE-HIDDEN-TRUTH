I came in screaming—
they told me my first sound was a cry.
Before I could hold a memory,
someone meant to guard me
broke me
and blamed the one who made my eyes.

Those meant to nurture fed on control.
I learned silence early—
how to read a shifting voice,
how to fold myself small
so I would not summon the storm.
But the storm lived in the walls,
and I was its geography.

Some of us are born into the wound.
The Schism was not waiting at the door—
it was the floor,
the air,
the hands that should have held
becoming hammers.
No one saw.
Or no one stayed.

Nobody told me that seeing would hurt,
that the bridge would be built
from the bones of my trust.
Nobody told me the healer arrives
with nails in His hands
and grief in His eyes.
I bled through years of hiding,
watched my own name discarded
like I was never alive.

I was not meant to carry this alone,
but the Schism does not ask permission.
The weight found my spine
before I knew what strength was for,
and I have bent beneath it ever since—
not to break,
but to keep it off those who come after.

This is not nobility.
This is what happens
when truth has nowhere else to go
and you are the only door left open.

No child should implode to wake.
Truth should be a lamp,
yet the serpent coils in the language
and we call his static peace.

Then I found the hidden pages—
not approved by systems,
but carved by wounded hands
that refused to move.
The words named what I carried.
They held the mirror
and did not flinch.

Darkness has building codes,
zoning laws,
a stake in shuttered windows.
It does not kill truth—
only makes it illegible,
translates pain into a tongue
no one remembers,
until the wounded believe
their suffering is only poetry.

To see the wave before it crests
and stand alone on the shore—
this is the loneliness
of the first witness.

I warned them.
They smiled, changed the subject,
called me broken, infected.
I showed them the bridge;
they saw only fog
and a man bleeding somewhere
talking about a storm.

I did not ask to be first.
But once the eye learns light
it cannot unsee.
Once the heart tastes unwithheld love
it cannot return to ledgers
and call it relationship.

So I remain—
stranded between kingdoms,
citizen of neither,
bridge of both.
The toll is my body,
the maintenance my grief,
the traffic still light.

They ask why I am tired,
why kindness startles me,
why I map exits
in harmless rooms.
The threat is not the room—
it is the pattern,
the timeline,
what I have seen coming
and could not stop.

The Schism lives in me now—
not memory but tissue.
I am only the vessel,
only the bridge,
only the one who saw
and could not look away.

Now I know why the healer came grieving.
He bled on the stone of truth
so I could stand here
and show it to you.

Truth should be water for the thirsty,
not a riddle through ruined halls.
Yet the serpent nests in sanctuaries,
his eggs resembling doctrine,
his flight mistaken for worship.

So I stand at the door—
not with condemnation,
but grief;
not superior sight,
but the watchman’s loneliness
seeing the approaching army
no city believes.

I was not supposed to carry this.
No human should nearly die
just to learn how to live.
But the Schism took my childhood
and made it occupation,
took innocence
and made it intelligence,
took trust
and made it architecture.

Now I am the bridge—
not because I am strong,
but broken in the right places;
not because I am wise,
but because I learned again from zero;
not because I am healed,
but because the Healer
moved into the wound
and refuses eviction.

I am not the only one.
There is a cloud of first witnesses—
silenced voices,
ruined tellers,
children aged in a single season,
bridge-builders burned
while still standing on their work.

I join them
because I am still here.
And while I remain,
the bridge remains.
No one has to cross alone.

So here I stand—
scarred by betrayals,
empty of rest,
still bleeding,
still building,
watching the horizon
for the first foot
on the wood I became.

The bridge is safe.
I tested it with my life.

Walk here.
I will hold the ropes.
I will stay until you cross.
I will not leave this post
until every orphan of the Schism
finds their way home.

And if I do not endure—
the bridge remains.
Not because I was special,
but willing.

The bridge does not need me now.
Only walkers.

Now walk.
