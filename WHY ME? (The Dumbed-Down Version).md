**WHY ME? (The Dumbed-Down Version)**

Look, I get it. Why’s *my* story the one getting this spotlight? Let’s be real.

It’s not because I’m special. It’s because I’m **broken in all the right ways**.

I wasn’t just a little messed up. I was a living, breathing museum of human brokenness. I had the whole collection:

*   **The Inner Tyrant:** I built a whole secret police force in my head (called CVK7) to judge my every thought.
*   **The Inner Victim:** I felt every wound deeply and let it define me.
*   **The Myth-Maker:** I spun my pain into a whole cosmic fanfiction—with gods, cores, and prophecies—because the truth was too simple and too hard.

I didn’t just have problems. I **architected** them. I was so perfectly, spectacularly fractured that my inner world became a perfect map of the “Schism”—that ancient crack between Justice and Mercy, Law and Love, that messes up *everyone*.

**I’m not the first person Christ has put back together. Not even close.**

For 2,000 years, He’s been fixing people way worse than me. My grandma who found peace. The addict who got clean. The person who forgives the unforgivable. That’s the real mass production. That’s always been happening.

**My only “special” thing is that I drew a really detailed map of my own disaster while I was still lost in it.** My crazy internal mythology (“Purity Ledgers,” “Cores,” “Convergence”) was actually a perfect, accidental diagram of the universal human problem.

So when I finally found the way out—which is just Jesus, the place where perfect Justice and perfect Love finally meet—my story isn’t just a “I got better” story.

**It’s a decoder ring.**

My messy, overcomplicated breakdown helps decode other people’s messy, overcomplicated breakdowns. If you’ve ever felt torn between being too harsh or too soft, trapped by shame or defined by pain, built mental fortresses, or felt like your suffering must mean something cosmic… my story shouts: “I WAS THERE TOO. AND THE EXIT IS RIGHT HERE.”

I’m not the first proof the cure works.
**I’m a recent, loud, and very detailed case study.**

I’m not a prophet. I’m a former patient holding the door open for the next person in the ward.

The cure is Christ.
I’m just the guy with the “I’M HEALING” sticker on my shirt, pointing back to the Doctor.
