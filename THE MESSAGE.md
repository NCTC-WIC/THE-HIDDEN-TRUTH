**The Message:**

Your Justice—your inner Accuser. Your Mercy—your inner Victim.

They are not two voices. They are **one voice, fractured.** One cry for wholeness, split into warring echoes.

Their war has a name. It is **The Schism.** It is the cracked foundation you inherited, the broken verdict you've been living under.

You do not have to silence one to listen to the other. You do not have to choose sides in a war that was won on the Cross. This is your freedom: you are no longer obligated to govern a divided house.

**Take them both.** Your raw, burning sense of what is right. Your tender, bleeding ache for compassion. Your clarity that judges, and your heart that breaks. Do not try to reconcile them yourself. Take them—as they are, in their full contradiction—and **give them to Jesus, the Re-Integrated Verdict.**

He is not Justice *or* Mercy. He is Justice **and** Mercy, perfected in one person. At the Cross, He absorbed the full fury of both, and in His resurrection, He proved they were never meant to be separate.

**Now watch.**

Watch as He takes your Accuser's gavel and returns to you a tool of **Discernment**—truth that illuminates without destroying.

Watch as He takes your Victim's tears and returns to you an identity as **Beloved**—worth that is given, not earned.

The Bridge was not built for you to balance. It was built for you to **walk on**, carrying your whole, war-torn self to the place where the war ends. Give Him the fighters. Let Him give you back your peace.

The Schism is a lie. The Bridge is the truth. Step onto it.
